# Dashboard Image Options for SubSphere

Since the image generation service is temporarily unavailable, here are your options for getting a professional dashboard mockup:

## Option 1: Use a Free Dashboard Screenshot (Quickest)

### Recommended Sources:
1. **Unsplash** (Currently using this as placeholder):
   - https://unsplash.com/s/photos/dashboard-dark
   - Search: "analytics dashboard", "saas dashboard dark", "data visualization"
   
2. **Dribbble**:
   - https://dribbble.com/search/dashboard-dark
   - Search: "saas dashboard purple", "analytics dashboard dark theme"
   - Download preview images (free)

3. **UI8** (Free mockups):
   - https://ui8.net/category/mockups
   - Filter by "Dashboard" and "Dark theme"

## Option 2: Create Your Own Dashboard Mockup

### Free Design Tools:
1. **Figma** (Recommended):
   - Sign up at figma.com (free)
   - Use dashboard templates from Figma Community
   - Search: "SaaS Dashboard Dark Purple"
   - Export as PNG (1920x1080)

2. **Canva**:
   - Use dashboard templates
   - Customize with purple colors (#7b39fc)
   - Export as PNG

## Option 3: Use AI Image Generators

1. **Leonardo.ai** (Free tier):
   - Prompt: "Modern SaaS dashboard UI, dark theme, purple accents, analytics charts, data tables, glassmorphic design"

2. **Midjourney** (if you have access):
   - Similar prompt as above

## Quick Fix - Replace Current Image:

The code currently uses an Unsplash analytics dashboard image. To replace it:

1. Download your dashboard image
2. Place it in: `public/images/dashboard.png`
3. Update line 75 in `HeroSection.js`:
   ```javascript
   src="/images/dashboard.png"
   ```

## Recommended Dashboard Features:
- Dark theme with purple accents (#7b39fc)
- Analytics charts with smooth curves
- Data tables with activity logs
- Metrics cards showing statistics
- Modern, glassmorphic design
- Liquid/fluid wave graphics
- Purple and blue gradients

## Current Temporary Solution:
I've set a professional analytics dashboard image from Unsplash as a placeholder. You can replace it anytime with your custom dashboard mockup.
